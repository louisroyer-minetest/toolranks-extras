# minetest-toolranks-extras
This minetest mod adds [toolranks](https://github.com/lisacvuk/minetest-toolranks) support for `minetest-games`â€™s mods (except `default`).
This mod currently adds support for hoes from `farming` mod.
This mod is compatible with [farming redo](https://notabug.org/tenplus1/farming) (nothing breaks if you have both installed).

## Settings
Settings are available to disable support of some mods (currently only `farming`). This is useful if you want to reimplement minetest-games modules
with a `toolranks` support. It is also possible to ask me to automatically disabling support if your mod is detected (like it is done with farming redo).
